			<h2>About me!🪩🕺</h2>
			<p>
				Allow me to briefly introduce myself! Alright, let's begin with the fundamentals. I am both Spanish and Catalan since I was born and raised in Llinars del Vallés, a small town on Spain's northeast coast (Barcelona). Even though I've spent all of my life living in Catalonia, I have family from Sevilla, located in the southern of Spain. However, since I was a child my parents used to send me to Ireland for a month with a host family to practice English and surf.  While I do speak 3 languages fluently, my French and German skills have remained in the 3 years I spent in high school and never came back. Aside from that, I consider myself quite driven and curious. Don’t hesitate to scroll down to find more things about me!

			<h2>My interests!🧘🏼‍♀️⛵🏄🏼‍♀️</h2>
			<p>
				Hola from my universe, which combines adventure and peacefulness, creativity and activity. I center myself and set the tone for the day ahead with yoga and meditation first thing in the morning. I have had a connection to the water since I was a little child: I initially experienced it via competitive synchronized sailing and swimming, and then I continued to enjoy the excitement of surfing as a pastime. When I'm not on the water, I devour books and fiction, writing and sharing my ideas and experiences. In fact, I'm constantly in search of the next great read. My passion for cuisine, travel, and the arts is a reflection of my interest in many cultures and forms of creativity. On the flip side, I also love going out a little too much as I have it in my Spanish veins…💃

			<h2>My hidden passion!🏘️✍️🩷</h2>
			<p>
				I have always been fascinated by interior design, and I have notebooks full of designs and ideas that help me make the connection between the imaginary and the actual world. My goal with every drawing is to make the complicated simple, so that each space may be a calm haven without losing its own personality. That’s why my trademark style is extremely inspired by this fusion of the modern and the classic, which directs my creation of rooms that celebrate the depth of living history and inspire peace.
